1.Define what a database is and give two real-world examples (not from the notes).

A database is an organized collection of data stored electronically in a computer system. 
It allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and management of information, often used by applications and users.
Databases are typically managed by a database management system (DBMS).

2.List three differences between relational and non-relational databases.

| Feature             | Relational (SQL)                   | Non-relational (NoSQL)                      |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Data Model & Schema | Structured tables, fixed schema    | Flexible documents, keyâ€‘value, graph        |
| Scalability         | Vertical scaling (stronger server) | Horizontal scaling (multiple nodes)         |
| Consistency         | Strong ACID consistency            | Eventual consistency (for distributed data) |

3.Name two advantages of using a DBMS.

Improved Data Security and Integrity -

A DBMS enforces access controls, authentication, and encryption to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. It also maintains integrity through constraints
(like primary keys, foreign keys, and check constraints), ensuring data remains accurate and consistent. 

Efficient Data Sharing & Reduced Redundancy -

A DBMS centralizes data storage, enabling multiple users and applications to access and update the same data concurrently. This prevents data duplication and inconsistencies while facilitating collaboration.

4.List three popular RDBMS and two popular NoSQL databases.

RDBMS
MySQL
PostgreSQL
Oracle Database
NoSQL
MongoDB 
Cassandra
